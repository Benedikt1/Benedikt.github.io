I think everyone would like that until they made their own family.<br>
<br>
For me, I wasn't able to hold on to that fleeting dream. <br>
<br>
My dad was a rich asshole who was nice in his youth but after some years <br>became an ass. <br>
<br>
It was when I was eight that mom divorced but she lost the custody war and <br>now I can barely see her because dad doesn't permit it. <br>
<br>
He got worse and after some time began to take his frustration out on me <br>whenever I was home. <br>
<br>
To deal with the anger that built up I took up two completely different <br>things. First was martial arts to vent my anger before I reached home where<br> I needed to remain calm against him. The other is japanese anime, manga<br> and light novels. These helped distract my mind from him when I was at <br>home were, after making dinner for the asshole I would lock myself in my room. <br>
<br>
I'm fifteen now and I've been getting ready for this day. Today is the same<br> day dad divorced with my mom a few years back and the hell began so I found<br> it appropriate to end my suffering on the same day.<br> 
<br>
I get home with an extra heavy backpack and quickly run up to my room and<br> lock the door just as I start to hear his ranting about food and money.<br> 
<br>
Ya, he makes me work like his personal slave so he can laze around. He <br>works the stock markets, and as much as I hate it, he is good at what he<br> does which is how he still has so much money after so long. Not like I get<br> access to much of it. Still, after he blows his extra money he uses me<br> to get more.<br> </p></div>
