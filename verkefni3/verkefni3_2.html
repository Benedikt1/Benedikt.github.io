<main><h1>bringa</h1> imagine myself waking up in a enclosed box which can said to be my safe point. While I'm busy creating my world, I also try to generate the perfect details, while visualizing an opening scene from the first episode of a Japanese animation, which I had watched last night “Akame ga kill”. The black and blood red opening scene, where the assassins had arrive. I always first possess the main protagonist or make my own original character from the story then from here on out I converse with the other side characters, make changes wherever I felt necessary. The point is I completely take over the life of a person and use it and do whatever I want. Now most people would argue that it's all in your head so why should we care. It's like a trashy neet who lived his whole life torturing his parents and has a crush on every beautiful girl he sees and he uses her for his sexual fantasy or imagination whatever you may call it, to fap, now back to the question why would people care what goes on my mind. The Short answer is that they don’t and the long answer is also they don’t. But the main point is that I  believe the world I create to be real somewhere in an alternate reality. However, I don't care what anybody thinks or feel about my actions and it's also not like I'm a neet!! I properly go to university, socialize, study etc.

The point is I consider myself to be above those life sucking slugs who think themselves to be the only ones who can be reincarnated. Well according to my research the ratio of people who tend to reincarnate are mostly people who were always at the bottom of the food chain  and may deserve a second chance in life while I'm against it. Though all I do is create my own fantasy world, but the truth is I'm preparing myself If I ever receive the honor of reincarnation. But for that to happen I wolf need to die. Hence, I always train myself in every possible situation I can encounter in the other world. The reference materials I use for my investigation are of course light novels, various anime series  and mangas.
