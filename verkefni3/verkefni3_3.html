<main><h1>smá partur af söguni "Azarinth Healer"</h1> Chapter 1 Boring introduction - Where is the magic?

 

The sheets slightly stirred, as more and more rays of sunlight pushed through the curtains. The early light illuminating the battlefield of a room that probably hadn’t seen much cleaning in the past couple days.

Dirty bowls, food packages and bottles littered the table, only interrupted by two screens and a half covered keyboard. The ground was covered by clothes, books and various other things. It would take another three hours and the full force of the sun to wake up what laid slumbering between the numerous pillows on the bed. Not leaving waking up to chance though, the mechanical device next to the bed sprang to life as the room was filled with noise.

A groan escaped the woman laying in the bed as an outstretched arm swiftly disabled the alarm clock. “Fuuuuck, it’s too early.” going back to sleep, the woman laid there for another fifteen minutes until the first of her five alarms on her phone sprang to life. After another half an hour, the last one was disabled and with another grunt the woman managed to sit up on her bed with all of her willpower. “Mornings suck.” she declared to the world and any gods that were listening. 

Not quite awake, the woman grudgingly left her warm nest and entered the small bathroom in her flat, her morning autopilot helping her dodge any stray item on the floor. Standing in the shower for ten minutes, her eyes slowly started to open and a bit of blue could be seen from between the lids. She nearly slipped when leaving the shower but caught herself in the last second. “Avoided death there...” murmuring, the woman left the bathroom with a toothbrush in her mouth. Fighting to get her socks on, sniffing on some clothes and lastly going back shirtless to the bathroom, she spat into the sink and looked into the mirror.

It was still steamy from the shower so she didn’t see anything but a blur there. Wiping on the mirror with her hand, her blue eyes stared back at her from the cleaned part. Taking a brush, she started to fight through her hair. Two minutes later the woman left her apartment and locked the door. ‘coffee’ she thought. Walking down the stairs, she squinted at the sun. ‘Such a nice day for work.’
